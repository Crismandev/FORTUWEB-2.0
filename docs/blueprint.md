# **App Name**: Clockwise Kiosk

## Core Features:

- Employee Login: Employees can log in using a pre-assigned ID. IDs are managed statically within the app (no database).
- Time Clock: Records the time of clock-in and clock-out for each employee.
- Shift Summary: Displays a summary of the current shift, including start time and duration.
- Timecard Generator Tool: Uses AI to intelligently create downloadable reports from timeclock entries. The AI tool chooses relevant parameters for each employee or time period.
- Admin Override: Allows administrators to manually adjust clock-in or clock-out times, with audit logging.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#9E2A2B) to convey formality, and avoid the perception of the app as playful or informal.
- Background color: Very light red/grey (#F2E8E8). It is subtly in the same family as the primary red, and appropriately light.
- Accent color: A desaturated orange-red (#C64A2E) that stands apart from the primary while remaining in harmony.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern interface suitable for both headings and body text.
- Use simple, clear icons for actions like clocking in/out.
- Ensure the layout is responsive for display on a variety of devices.
- Use subtle animations to confirm actions (e.g., a checkmark animation after clocking in).
